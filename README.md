<!-- About me -->
<h2 align="center"> About Me: </h2>

<p align="center"> Iâ€™m a data analyst with a degree in Finance and a minor in French from California State University San Marcos, along with a Data Science & Visualization Certificate from UC San Diego. Iâ€™m passionate about using data to uncover insights and tell meaningful stories. </p>

<p align="center"> I have experience working with tools like Snowflake, SQL, Tableau, Alteryx, Python, and Excel to support business decisions and build scalable reporting. Whether itâ€™s automating a manual process or building a dashboard from scratch, I love creating solutions that help teams work smarter. </p>

<p align="center"> Outside of work, I enjoy learning new tools and sharpening my technical skills. Iâ€™ve earned certifications in Alteryx, Power BI, Excel, and QuickBooks Online. I thrive both independently and as part of a collaborative teamâ€”especially when it involves solving a tough data problem. </p>

<p align="center"> Always curious and always learning! </p>
